# Train-Schedule

This train schedule application shows users different trains that have been added to a firebase database.

The application allows users to enter in information for a train that isnt on the table including the trains name, destination, frequency and first arrival time.

This information is then added to a database and displayed in a table on the screen showing the minutes left until the next arrival.
